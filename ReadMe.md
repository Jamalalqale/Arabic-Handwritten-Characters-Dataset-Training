# Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset


- In this work, we model a deep learning architecture that can be effectively apply to recognizing Arabic handwritten characters. We are going to Apply Knn algoruthm on our data and train it by 3 methods: Regression  tree, Multi perception layer MLP and Convolutional Neural Network CNN.
- The data-set is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants, the age range is between 19 to 40 years, and 90% of participants are right-hand.The database is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440 characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class).


## Conclusion
We applied 3 types of trainging, Regression Tree,MPL and CNN, and as a result we foun out that the best way to train this data-set is by CNN, which give us 92.07% of accuracy, while regrisson tree gave us -14%, and MPL gave us 48%.
